# Cyberstats

## Cyber Security Market Analysis, Norway

This project provides an in-depth analysis of the Norwegian Cyber Security market, showcasing market growth, share distribution among companies, financial summaries, trends, and more through dynamic visualizations and data tables. It leverages technologies such as Streamlit for web app development, Pandas for data manipulation, Plotly Express for interactive charts, and Google Sheets for data storage and retrieval, all orchestrated with Python.

## Motivation

The motivation behind open sourcing this Python code is to encourage individuals, especially those who do not consider themselves professional developers. By sharing this project, I hope to lower the barriers to contributing to open source, fostering a more inclusive and collaborative community where everyone feels empowered to share their work, learn from others, and contribute to collective knowledge.

## NOT MAINTAINED AND NOT WRITTEN BY A PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPER
Please note that this project is a personal initiative and is not actively maintained. It serves as an example and a learning resource for those interested in data analysis and web app development with Python.
